 # Errors Encountered

Adding to Reading List

Issue: Initially, implementing the reading list feature was difficult due to structuring relationships between users and books.

Solution: Introduced a separate ReadingList model to track users and their selected books.

Rating System

Issue: Storing ratings and linking them to users and books was challenging.

Solution: Implemented a Ratings model where users can submit ratings, and books can have an average rating displayed.

Logout Issue

Issue: Users remained logged in even after attempting to log out.

Solution: Fixed session handling in Flask by ensuring that session data was properly cleared on logout.
